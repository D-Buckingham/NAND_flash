## Introduction

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of integrating NAND flash memory in the Zephyr RTOS using the DHARA Flash Translation Layer (FTL). The integration ensures reliable storage management, wear leveling, and error correction, making it suitable for embedded applications requiring non-volatile storage.

## Prerequisites

- **Hardware**: For example the nrf5340dk in combination with an external test bench.
- **Software**:
  - Zephyr RTOS
  - VS Code
  - nrf Connect in VS Code
- **Tools**:
  - Git
  - CMake
  - West
  - A supported compiler (e.g., GCC)

## Setup and Configuration

### Hardware Setup

1. **Connect NAND Flash**: Ensure the NAND flash is correctly connected to the development board according to the following illustration.
2. **Verify Connections**: Double-check the connections, especially the data lines, control signals, and power supply.

### Software Setup

1. **Clone Zephyr Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr.git
    cd zephyr
    git checkout <desired_version>
    ```

2. **Set Up Zephyr SDK**:
    Follow the [Zephyr Getting Started Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html) to install and set up the Zephyr SDK.

3. **Clone DHARA Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/dvhart/dhara.git
    cd dhara
    ```

4. **Add DHARA to Your Zephyr Project**:
    - Place the DHARA source code in the `modules` directory of your Zephyr project.
    - Modify your `CMakeLists.txt` to include DHARA.

## Integrating DHARA with NAND Flash

### NAND Flash Driver Integration

1. **Write the NAND Flash Driver**:
    - Implement the necessary functions to interact with your specific NAND flash memory.
    - Ensure the driver supports basic operations such as read, write, and erase.

2. **Configure the NAND Driver in Zephyr**:
    - Create or modify the Device Tree Source (DTS) file to include the NAND flash.
    - Define the NAND flash parameters (e.g., page size, block size) in the DTS file.
